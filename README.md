# customCarputer

## Notes:
- This is intended for a gen 2 Prius (2003-2009), it may work on other cars with some modification.
- documation is minimal as the code in this repo was only intended for my use. I am trying to add some documation so if someone else wants to use this as a "guide" they can (hopefully).
